Not a usual web project</h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p>When your team (or you) decide to use AngularJS as a framework for your project
you make a step into <strong>Single-Page Application world</strong>
where usual skills for front-end
developers are very different by value.</p><p>In classic web projects you can have guys who will be able to write data access
code with database communication but also them should work with client-side techonologies
like Javascript, CSS and HTML. Usually them are dislike it.
Correct solution here is introduce specialization between team members. One group is working
on data access and business logic, but second group is working on representation layer.</p><p>In classic projects (non SPA) it works not good 
(even with strong MVC separation in architecture)
because anyway such groups share same code. And no way to split it because them share one
server-side language (like PHP, Ruby or C#) for them tasks. Tasks are different, but language is one.
Javascript plays second role because templates are produced by server. It generates a lot load to the
server but it is an another story.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="well well-sm"><p class="text-center lead">Team structure difference:</p><div class="row"><div class="col-md-1"><p>Classic:</p></div><div class="col-md-11"><p class="text-center">         
A team for

 <span class="label label-warning">PHP/Ruby</span> <span class="label label-primary">SQL/NoSQL</span></p><p class="text-center">         
A client-side team for
 <span class="label label-success">Javascript</span> <span class="label label-info">HTML/CSS</span> <span class="label label-danger">UI/Design          </span></p></div></div></div><p>To make long story short here is AngularJS for. It can replace all server-side template systems
and move this tasks to the client browser. Server will be used only for data-access.
Your teams will get full separation of development and will use right tools for each task.
Client-side team will work with Javascript (or any dialect like Coffeescript) as a
main language, but your server-side team will use its favorite server-side language like
PHP/Ruby/etc.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3"></div></div><h3>2. Client-side is important</h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4"><p>Many time ago teams thought server-side is more important than
client-side because it should save data and data is all.
But for current time we live in a startup-world where customer
discover is the most important to achieve project goals.
And here client-side is a place where your clients meets your
goods and services. </p><p> 
So, how better your client-side will be
so bigger amount of clients you will get.
And here it is important to handle all complex cases of logic on client-side,
but usual jquery-coders can't do it in right way.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><p> 
Because them will be able to
know full spectrum of new techonologies which are difficult to learn at once.
For example, them will need to know: Promises, ViewModel, Model-View-ViewModel,
SOLID principles, REST design, Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Development,
Functional code style and many other stuff...</p><p>Just because client-side is your face it is important to have strong coders
on board to produce stable releases or anybody who will do a mentoring job.</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><div class="well well-sm"><p class="text-center lead">Usual tasks for client-side:</p><ul class="fa-ul"><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Prepare UI concept</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Define transitions</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Draw design</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Split design into small pieces of html/css</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Introduce view models based on user expected behaviour</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Prepare unit-tests and mocks</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Write client-side business logic to connect views and models</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Write data access logic to retrieve data from server-side</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Write Selenium tests to verify requirements</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Turn on build process</li><li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i> Turn on deployment process</li></ul></div></div></div><h3>3. Time is money</h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p>Of course your team can spend a lot of time to get experience in AngularJS
but it is long and risky, because your coders may be don't have enough
knowledge in needed technologies or you hired a team which consists
only from developers who don't have good background. You need a mentor for your team
in that case.</p><div class="well well-sm"><p class="text-center">Case "You change a contractor"</p><p> 
You start a project with first scope of work and hire a low level developer.
Something was gone wrong and you decided to start new scope of work with a middle developer.
But the developer told you all is bad and you need to restart the project.</p><p class="text-center"> 
1600$ x 2 months + 3200$ x 3 months = 
 <strong>12800$</strong></p><p>If you had used our services from the early stage, you would have continued current project without restart.</p><p class="text-center"> 
(1600$ + 
 <strong>1200$</strong>) x 2 months + 3200$ x 1 months = 
 <strong>8800$</strong></p></div><p> 
Just imagine what can happen if you decide to hire another team to continue the work.
Because your coders don't have enough experience with AngularJS them will produce
very unsupportive code. It is why any experienced developer who will be hired by you will
make you to start a new project instead of continue current. </p></div><div class="col-md-6"><p> 
And he will be right
because any changes will break release in unpredictable cases. Of course you may say he shoud
write unit tests but I say you it can be impossible too. I seen many projects where even
Selenium tests may only say "May be ok, but don't know in total".</p><div class="well well-sm"><p class="text-center">Case "You work with middles"</p><p>You made a right decision at early stage and hired not bad middle developers for 1st and 2nd scope of work.
But you are dissapointed because the work is gone in unpredictable way: 
sometimes all is ok, but sometimes your team is working much harder on light tasks. 
What is going on? You are worry and it is bad to make right business decisions.</p><p class="text-center"> 
3200$ x 3 months (1 month for deep refactor) = 
 <strong>9600$</strong></p><p>vs
Same thing as above: If I had helped your team from the start, the team would have worked in predictable way.</p><p class="text-center">(3200$ + 
 <strong>1200$</strong>) x 2 months = 
 <strong>8800$    </strong></p></div><p>You will spend a lot time and money in case when you will need to hire another team.
